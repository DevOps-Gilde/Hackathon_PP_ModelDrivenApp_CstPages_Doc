The learning goals are as stated before:

## Layouting controls

As you know it from other environments our application shall support responsive layout so we will avoid pixel based statements. A key are containers that allow to layout their children components are horizontally or vertically. Child controls can be seized relatively based on a percentage (1 corresponds to entire space). The screenshot below shows how to layout the controls when we think in containers:

Let's now implement the layout with the indicated controls. We will start with the first one which is the vertical container for the content. Adding controls always follows the same pattern which is as follows:
* Select the parent control on the canvas
* Pick the control from the list
* Adjust properties
We have to do the following adjustments for our newly added container:
* Reorder
* Set fill
* Rename

Insert the remaining controls and name them accordingly:
!Control               !Name Parent !Name      !
!----------------------!------------!----------!
!Form                  !TODO        !TODO      !
!Submit Button         !TODO        !TODO      !
