# 1. Introduction to Import Database

Due to time constraints we won't create all required tables step by step within dataverse. We will use instead a transport mechanism to deploy a fully implemented database model. This approach can be used for any artefact that has been created within PowerPlatform. Microsoft calls deployable code packages also "Solutions". Essentially they boil down to a Zip file that contains the artefacts in an internal Microsoft format that you should always treat as black box.
