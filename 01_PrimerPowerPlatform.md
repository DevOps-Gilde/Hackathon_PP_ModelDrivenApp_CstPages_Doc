# 1. Introduction to Power Platform

Power Platform is the low code platform from Microsoft. If required also coding is possible e.g. by providing JavaScript. The Microsoft cloud service Azure is the foundation of the platform. This primer won't cover all aspects of the platform. It focuses at the aspects that are important for this hackathon.

# 2. Web portal of Power Platform

The most important tool from the hackathon perspective is the web portal. It allows to work with all relevant components for our hackathon such as the Dataverse, Power Apps and solutions. The portal is scoped to a certain environment and a user. A PowerPlatform environment represents an environment such as dev or prod as you know it from software engineering. PowerPlatform environment types are for instance sandbox or production. The pictur below shows a screenshot of the portal.

Cooments regarding the picture:
* The red boxes in the picture mark the environment and the user.
* On the left hand side you have the main navigation that allows you to reach Dataverse, Power Apps and solutions.

# 3. Dataverse

Dataverse are managed services that can live in an environment. They allow ypu to persist data and is designed for transactional data. For analytic worloads Microsoft recommends switching to Azure. The core service is a SQL server but as you can see in the picture Dataverse is a implemented behind the sceen by a bunch of services.

The central element for storing data are tables. A table is just another entity in Power Platform as for instance a Power App. Columns, keys, views and relationships are compareable to the counterparts in relational databses. The following points summarize power platform concepts starting from relational database counterparts:

* **Custom table:** Is a table that you define on top on the existing ones defined by the system such as "account". For our hackathon we use only custom tables without reusing existing ones.
* **Predefined columns:** A newly created custom table comes with a lot of predefined columns.
* **Primary Key:** Power Platform differentiates between the primary key that you name and an internal id (GUID). We will hit a scenario where we will need the internal GUID for referencing a record.
* **Keys:** Unique constraints for one or multiple columns can be modelled via keys.
* **Business Rules:** The allow to model constraints in general such as limiting vaues to a certain range. 
* **Autogenerated values:** In power platform you don't have separate sequence objects but you can specify the value as autogenerated according to a certain pattern.
* **Relationships:** They correspond to foreign key constraints in relational databases. Power platform uses partially a special terminology. An example are lookup columns that boil down to a relationship under the hood.
* **Choices:** You can think of them as an enum or a table with key value pairs. Relational databases don't provide something like that out of the box. You can limit a column to these values by associating the column with the choice as part of the column definition.

# 4. Model-driven-Apps

Model driven apps are a special application type within power apps. Besides you have:
* Portal pages
* Canvas
A discussion of these types beyond the scope of this hackathon.

Model driven apps consist of a number of pages. Each page can use one of the three technologies which greatly differ from the developer experience:
1. Based on dataverse tables
2. Custom Pages (Our focus)
3. Dashboards
These three options are also reflected by the main choice you have to make when adding a page:

Custom pages can give you a citizen developer like experience. Compared to  the dataverse table option they are closer to architecture principles for professional developers since the UI is not directly bound to the tables. However unexpected shortcomings were identified during that hackathon and the licensing is still per user. Only power pages provide licenses that are for a bunch of users.

# 5. Power Automate

Power automate propagates a workflow like business logic rogramming style that boils down to a graph. The trigger is the starting point, actions are represented by boxes and the lines between the boxes determine what comes next. Access to data sources or third party systems is provided by connectors that are used by the actions under the hood. The picture below shows a simple example of a few sequential steps:

Comments regarding the picture:
* Trigger of the flow is a Power App
* The flow uses variables to transport information all the way down to the end
* The action "Add Row" adds a row to the specified dataverse table. It is an example that uses a connector under the hood.

There are various types of flows but the major distinction for us is the following:
1. Stand alone flow that is defined in Power Automate
2. Flow that is embedded in a Power App
We will use the second option since option one requires higher licenses.

# 6. Solutions

The standard way to program in a low code platform is rather clicking instead of coding. That is fine for dev/ test environments. But think of production as environment. There clicking together is no option. You rather want to transfer what you clicked together as it is to production. That requires a programmatic way to export something from your dev/ test environment and import it to production.

The vehicle is a solution which can transport any artefact from power platform. You can click it together in the portal or by exporting it.
